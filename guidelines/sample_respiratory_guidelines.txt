SECTION 1: IDIOPATHIC PULMONARY FIBROSIS (IPF)
Source: ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT Evidence-Based Guidelines for IPF (2022 Update)
================================================================

1.1 DIAGNOSIS
IPF is a specific form of chronic, progressive fibrosing interstitial pneumonia of unknown cause, occurring primarily in older adults, limited to the lungs.
Diagnosis requires:
- Exclusion of other known causes of interstitial lung disease (ILD), e.g. domestic/occupational exposures, connective tissue disease, drug toxicity.
- HRCT pattern of Usual Interstitial Pneumonia (UIP): honeycombing with or without peripheral, subpleural, basal predominant traction bronchiectasis.
- Histopathological UIP pattern on surgical lung biopsy in appropriate clinical context when HRCT pattern is not typical UIP.
Key HRCT features of UIP: subpleural, basal predominant honeycombing; traction bronchiectasis; absence of features suggesting alternative diagnosis.

1.2 WORKUP (RECOMMENDED)
- Pulmonary function tests (spirometry + DLCO): expected restrictive pattern (FVC↓, FEV1/FVC normal/↑, DLCO↓)
- 6-minute walk test: assess functional capacity and desaturation
- Echocardiography: exclude pulmonary hypertension
- Bronchoalveolar lavage: may help exclude alternative diagnoses; not diagnostic for IPF
- Surgical lung biopsy: indicated when HRCT is indeterminate; VATS preferred
- Serological workup: ANA, RF, anti-CCP, myositis panel, to exclude connective tissue disease-associated ILD

1.3 MANAGEMENT (GUIDELINE RECOMMENDATIONS)
- Antifibrotic therapy is recommended for most patients with IPF:
  Nintedanib or pirfenidone — shown to slow FVC decline; discuss with specialist.
- Treat gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) if present — potential role in disease progression.
- Refer all suitable patients for lung transplantation evaluation at time of diagnosis.
- Supplemental oxygen for patients with resting or exertional hypoxaemia (SpO2 <88%).
- Pulmonary rehabilitation: improves exercise tolerance and quality of life; conditionally recommended.
- Avoid immunosuppression with prednisone + azathioprine + N-acetylcysteine combination (shown to be harmful).
- Palliative care integration: discuss symptom management, advance care planning early.

1.4 MONITORING
- FVC every 3–6 months: decline >10% in 12 months indicates disease progression and/or treatment failure.
- DLCO every 6–12 months.
- Chest HRCT: not routinely repeated unless clinical deterioration or to evaluate for complications.
- Acute exacerbation of IPF: bilateral, diffuse alveolar damage superimposed on UIP background — high mortality; refer urgently.

================================================================
SECTION 2: COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA (CAP)
Source: IDSA/ATS Consensus Guidelines on CAP (2019 Update)
================================================================

2.1 DIAGNOSIS
CAP is defined as an acute infection of the pulmonary parenchyma acquired outside the hospital setting.
Diagnostic criteria (two or more):
- New or progressive infiltrate on chest imaging
- Fever >38°C or hypothermia <36°C
- Productive cough, purulent sputum, or change in sputum character
- Auscultatory findings consistent with pneumonia
- WBC >10,000 or <4,000 cells/mm³

Severity assessment using PSI (Pneumonia Severity Index) or CURB-65 is recommended to guide site-of-care decision.
CURB-65 ≥2 suggests hospitalisation; CURB-65 ≥3 suggests ICU consideration.

2.2 WORKUP
- Chest X-ray (posterior-anterior and lateral): confirm infiltrate
- Pulse oximetry: assess need for supplemental oxygen
- Blood cultures x2 (before antibiotics) for hospitalised patients with severe CAP
- Sputum Gram stain and culture: in hospitalised patients who can produce a good specimen
- Urinary antigen tests: Legionella pneumophila, Streptococcus pneumoniae — in severe CAP
- HIV testing: consider in CAP in adults <55 years without a clear predisposing condition
- Procalcitonin: may guide antibiotic de-escalation; not to replace clinical assessment

2.3 MANAGEMENT
Antibiotic selection should be guided by microbiological data when available. Initial empirical therapy:
- Outpatient, no comorbidities: amoxicillin monotherapy or doxycycline (discuss with prescribing clinician)
- Outpatient, with comorbidities: amoxicillin-clavulanate or respiratory fluoroquinolone (local resistance patterns apply)
- Inpatient, non-ICU: beta-lactam + macrolide combination OR respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy
- ICU: beta-lactam + azithromycin OR beta-lactam + respiratory fluoroquinolone
Duration: 5 days for most non-severe CAP if clinically improving (afebrile, improving WBC, tolerating oral intake).
Note: Specific antibiotic choices, dosages, and durations must be confirmed with a clinician and local formulary.

2.4 MONITORING
- Clinical reassessment at 48–72 hours for treatment response
- Chest X-ray: not routinely repeated at hospital discharge; follow-up at 4–8 weeks in high-risk patients (age >50, smoker) to exclude malignancy

================================================================
SECTION 3: TUBERCULOSIS (TB)
Source: WHO Guidelines for Treatment of Drug-Susceptible Tuberculosis (2022)
================================================================

3.1 DIAGNOSIS
Pulmonary TB suspected when:
- Prolonged cough (≥2 weeks), haemoptysis, fever, night sweats, weight loss, fatigue
- Contact with known TB case
- HIV positive with any respiratory symptoms
- Chest X-ray abnormalities (upper lobe infiltrates, cavities, miliary pattern)

Microbiological confirmation:
- Sputum smear microscopy (acid-fast bacilli): widely available; moderate sensitivity
- GeneXpert MTB/RIF (Xpert): recommended first-line test — simultaneous TB detection and rifampicin resistance
- Sputum culture (Löwenstein–Jensen or MGIT): gold standard; 2–8 weeks
- IGRA (interferon-gamma release assay) or tuberculin skin test: for latent TB, not active disease

3.2 MANAGEMENT (DRUG-SUSCEPTIBLE TB)
Standard regimen: 6-month course in two phases.
- Intensive phase (2 months): isoniazid (H), rifampicin (R), pyrazinamide (Z), ethambutol (E) — HRZE
- Continuation phase (4 months): isoniazid (H), rifampicin (R) — HR
Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) or supported treatment (DOTS): recommended to ensure adherence.
Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) supplementation: with isoniazid in patients at risk of peripheral neuropathy (malnutrition, diabetes, HIV, pregnancy, alcohol use).
Note: Dosages must be confirmed with TB programme protocols and a clinician. Drug-resistant TB requires specialist referral.

3.3 MONITORING
- Sputum smear/culture at 2 months and at end of treatment
- Liver function tests if hepatotoxicity symptoms arise (jaundice, nausea, vomiting)
- Visual acuity assessment: before and monthly during ethambutol therapy
- Chest X-ray: not required to confirm cure; microbiological confirmation used

================================================================
SECTION 4: COPD (CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE)
Source: GOLD 2023 Report — Global Strategy for Prevention, Diagnosis and Management of COPD
================================================================

4.1 DIAGNOSIS
COPD is a heterogeneous lung condition characterised by chronic respiratory symptoms due to airway and/or alveolar abnormalities caused by significant exposure to noxious particles or gases.
Spirometric confirmation: post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC <0.70 confirms persistent airflow obstruction.
GOLD severity grades (based on post-bronchodilator FEV1):
- GOLD 1 (Mild): FEV1 ≥80% predicted
- GOLD 2 (Moderate): 50% ≤ FEV1 <80%
- GOLD 3 (Severe): 30% ≤ FEV1 <50%
- GOLD 4 (Very Severe): FEV1 <30%

4.2 WORKUP
- Post-bronchodilator spirometry: mandatory for diagnosis; peak flow not sufficient
- Chest X-ray: exclude alternative diagnoses; may show hyperinflation, bullae, flat diaphragm
- CT chest: not routine; consider if diagnostic doubt or surgical evaluation
- Pulse oximetry: screen for hypoxaemia at rest
- ABG (arterial blood gas): if SpO2 <92% or severe exacerbation
- Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency testing: in patients with early-onset COPD, lower lobe emphysema, minimal smoking history, or family history

4.3 MANAGEMENT (STABLE COPD)
Non-pharmacological (all patients):
- Smoking cessation: most effective intervention; offer pharmacotherapy support
- Influenza vaccine annually; pneumococcal vaccine
- Pulmonary rehabilitation: strongly recommended for GOLD 2–4, MRC dyspnoea ≥2
- Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT): if resting PaO2 ≤55 mmHg or SpO2 ≤88%

Inhaled pharmacotherapy (GOLD ABCD framework — confirm with clinician):
- All symptomatic patients: short-acting bronchodilator (SABA/SAMA) for relief
- Group A: short-acting bronchodilator prn
- Group B: long-acting bronchodilator (LABA or LAMA)
- Group E (≥2 exacerbations/year or ≥1 hospitalisation): LABA + LAMA ± ICS (if eos ≥300)

4.4 MONITORING
- Spirometry: annually or with significant symptom change
- CAT score / mMRC dyspnoea: at each visit
- Exacerbation frequency: drives escalation/de-escalation of therapy
- Acute exacerbation of COPD: increased dyspnoea, sputum volume/purulence; manage with bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids (5-day course), antibiotics if indicated

================================================================
SECTION 5: HEART FAILURE
Source: ESC Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Acute and Chronic Heart Failure (2021)
================================================================

5.1 DIAGNOSIS
Heart failure (HF) is defined as a clinical syndrome of symptoms and/or signs caused by structural and/or functional cardiac abnormality.
HFrEF (reduced EF): LVEF ≤40%
HFmrEF (mildly reduced EF): LVEF 41–49%
HFpEF (preserved EF): LVEF ≥50%

Symptoms: dyspnoea, orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, reduced exercise tolerance, fatigue, ankle swelling
Signs: elevated JVP, pulmonary crackles, peripheral oedema, S3 gallop

Key investigations:
- ECG: look for atrial fibrillation, LVH, bundle branch block, ischaemia
- Chest X-ray: cardiomegaly (CTR >0.5), pulmonary venous congestion, Kerley B lines, pleural effusion
- NT-proBNP or BNP: elevated in HF; very high negative predictive value if normal
- Echocardiography: cornerstone — assess systolic/diastolic function, valvular disease, wall motion
- Blood tests: FBC, renal function, electrolytes, LFTs, fasting glucose, lipids, thyroid function

5.2 MANAGEMENT (HFrEF, LVEF ≤40%)
Four pillars of evidence-based therapy (discuss with cardiologist for dosing):
1. ACE inhibitor or ARB or ARNI (sacubitril/valsartan) — reduces mortality
2. Beta-blocker (bisoprolol, carvedilol, metoprolol succinate) — reduces mortality
3. MRA (spironolactone or eplerenone) — reduces mortality in NYHA II–IV
4. SGLT2 inhibitor (dapagliflozin, empagliflozin) — reduces HF hospitalisation and mortality
Diuretics (loop diuretics): symptom relief for congestion; no mortality benefit per se.
Note: Specific drug choices, initiating doses, and titration must be managed by a clinician. Uptitrate as tolerated.

5.3 MONITORING
- Clinical assessment: weight, oedema, JVP, blood pressure, heart rate at each visit
- Renal function and electrolytes: 1–2 weeks after initiating/changing therapy, then 3–6 monthly
- Echocardiography: repeat 3–6 months after optimising therapy; annually thereafter
- NT-proBNP: serial measurements to guide therapy in some centres
